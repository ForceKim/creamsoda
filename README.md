What is it?
-----------

Basically just a straight Find & Replace of Tequila; original readme is included for reference.

One extra feature was added I guess; the ability to view servers' associated webpages directly
in the launcher. Aside from that, it's pretty much just cosmetic changes.

Why?
----

City of Heroes should be free for everyone, and not controlled by a single entity. The ability
for someone - anyone - to gatekeep the community must be addressed. The creator of Tequila still
controls the default manifest for it, so Cream Soda was created to give people an alternate
launcher if they're not comfortable trusting Tequila.

I'll continue to update this as and when I get the chance with additional features, and any
requests for servers to be added to the manifest can go to contact@thunderspy.com. within
reason, any request will be honored. Although please, if you can't handle like 3000 people
accessing your server and haven't set up a queue system... don't blame me for the fire lmao.
